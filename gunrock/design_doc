Frontier class:
need both: per-edge/per-node data and graph data
an array with type: v or e. length (done)

operator:
advance(v2v,v2e,e2v,e2e)
filter(with or without deduplication)
compute(launch lambda function on each elements in the frontier)

Problem:
per-edge/node data
graph data (done)
global data

Enactor:
define several lambda functions
usually define two frontiers
define visited_mask, d_scanned_row_offsets,
they should be independent from problem
